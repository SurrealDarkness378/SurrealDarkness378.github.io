okay, so let me see if this works.

Living a life like this is insane. I cannot focus on anything productive, the only thing I can see is destruction. I want to speak again whit whom I find beautiful and worthy of my eternal struggle. I do not know what sense life has without the things I love. I need something to obsess over, preferably something positive, that can lead to something that brings me, at the same time, closer to my desired goals. maybe starting to read more again could help, maybe playing video games as well (I heard that latter can help with the regaining of grey matter in certain. areas of the brain, which would mean that it could increase my ability to focus and therefore work again). I wish I could find a way to do so then I could focus on what is truly important to me, which is, understanding the foundations of the abstract world, the nature of… well, of nature. I believe that mathematics, at its most fundamental levels and shapes is, possibly, the key to understand what lays beyond the boundaries of human perception. Human minds are limited to only be able to “sense”, and therefore interact with a potentially very limited part of the whole world or universe (I am uncertain about which term works best, is the universe defined as the sum of all the phenomena that we can possibly observe, given the way our brain is structured, the laws of physics that describe those interactions with the external reality, that outside of our own mental universe, and the technology that we can ultimately develop, be there a restriction we are not fully aware of yet, as some scientists and philosophers say). The rest of this world is fully inaccessible to us, and, even worse, we are completely ignorant of this most of the time with our theories. It would be incredible for me, if we could, in fact, devise fully self-consistent mathematical laws of physics that would describe perfectly only the known side of this world, without finding paradoxes or contradictions. More so, I am still very confused about the exact relationship between mathematics and the laws of reality. Perhaps (but this is one of the most unjustified hypotheses that I am going to make in this ramble), the exact nature of this relationship would become apparent, even trivial, that mathematics and the discovered (or so invented) rules of logic are in fact of the exact same nature as are those of physics.


What if everything is, in fact, pure mathematics, and the difference and limitations of restricting these rules on them actioning only on a material universe is simply the construct of our minds… okay, this does not hold because then I would have to explain what our minds are, and therefore how they themselves are inherently dissociated from this “illusory” material world.

Let me try to write a bit about how it feels like to be bipolar. To start with, I will have to say that I am diagnosed with a somewhat different version of bipolar, in a way, a milder form of the disorder though that would not make for a complete definition.
It starts almost unnoticeably, at first, there is a slight disposition towards seeking out more entertainment, be it through interacting with more people than you usually are comfortable with, indulging in forms of media or other pleasures to harness the dopamine rush that they bring, or by simply taking more risks and thriving on the thrill that those give. Then it is the realization that a lot of your afore defined boundaries and inhibitions tend to fall when you are faced with making various decisions, and more often than would be thoughtfully implied, tend to take these decisions inn a hasty manner. A few days pass and insomnia becomes a severe issue,



Time boundaries… I wish I could repair it.
